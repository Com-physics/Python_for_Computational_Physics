Throughout this project, we mostly use many python modules to make a program simple and efficient.

Most of the modules or not pre-installed in python however we can manually install with the pip command.

How to install module?

To answer this, we assume that you're using a unix based operating system such as, any linux distro or mac, in that case you can simply open the terminal and type the following command

pip install 'module name'

To install directly in Jupyter notebook type the following command

!pip install 'module name'

In the Windows system you can simply run the same command as in the unix system in cmd, however if you're installed in a directory other than the C drive, you need to assign the environmental path and open the cmd in the installed location and run the command.

Details of the modules:

Numpy:

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

To install numpy:

pip install numpy

Matplotlib:

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

To install matplotlib

pip install matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Sympy:

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.
